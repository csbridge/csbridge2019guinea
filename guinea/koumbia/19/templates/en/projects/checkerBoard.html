						This is a bonus program! It's meant to be challenging.
				</p>
				<p>
					Program Karel to create a checkerboard pattern of beepers inside an empty rectangular world. If Karel starts in a world as shown below...
                    <p>
					<center>
						<img style="width:300px;border:2px solid grey" src="{{pathToRoot}}img/projects/checkerboardKarel/checkerboardKarelStart.png">	
					</center>
                    </p>
                    <p>...then the world should end up looking like this.</p>
                    <p>
 					<center>
						<img style="width:300px;border:2px solid grey" src="{{pathToRoot}}img/projects/checkerboardKarel/checkerboardKarelFinish.png">	
					</center>
                    </p>
                    <p>
					 Note that where Karel finishes, as well as which direction Karel is facing at the finish, does not matter.
        </p>

				<p>
					Please ensure that your solution works with different sized worlds. For example, your solution should work for worlds with only one column or only one row. Your solution should also work for worlds that are not perfectly square.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p>
					Remember that you may only use Karel syntax and can not use Java variables. As you think about your solution, keep in mind all of the different sized worlds you could encounter. Be sure to test on these different worlds after you have completed your first attempt at a solution!
