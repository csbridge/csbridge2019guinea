					You are the director of an organization, but you do not have a stamp to mark the documents you sign. Time to create your own stamp to use for the documents you sign! 
				<p>
				<p>
					Write a program that has a GRect (which represents a stamp) follow a users mouse around and draw a GRect on the screen centered around the mouse when the user clicks </p>

				<p>
					<center>
						<img style="width:500px" src="{{pathToRoot}}img/projects/stampTool/demo.png">	
					</center>
				</p>

				<p>Rember that since you need to have a variable that you can change inside a mouse event class (the GRect which represents your stamp) you are going to have to declare it as an istance variable. Ask one of the teachers to explain this if it doesn't make sense.</p>

				</p>
				Now that you have made a simple rectangle stamp, you can modify it (for example, color, size, etc.) to use on your own documents! Have fun!
